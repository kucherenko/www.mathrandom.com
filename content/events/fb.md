Parser combinators are a powerful abstraction that allows desribing the parsing of complex grammars in a small amount of code. In this talk, I will introduce the concepts of a parser and parser combinator, and also demonstrate how you can write a parser of a search query with boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, parentheses and quotes in ~200 lines of TypeScript code.
