## Nest.js 

NestJS is a framework with excellent documentation and a mature ecosystem. But during this talk, we will not retell its docs. We will go deeper.

The plan is:
- base packages,
- application lifecycle,
- request context and lifecycle,
- declarative code with decorators,
- testing and documentation.
  
This talk will create a better understanding of Nest.js architecture.
